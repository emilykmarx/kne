These are attempts at adding a HOST node behind srl0, with link host .7 <=> srl0 .6
Host's curl got to egress, but didn't get natted (compare tcpdump at egress of host when curling from host vs curling from srl0)
Tried removing docker ip routes from host, and conntrack -F

This doesn't include a route from host to egress (out of laziness)
Also assumes Istio gateway will be 172.18.0.X (see host routes)
Host setup script is confusingly called egress_...
